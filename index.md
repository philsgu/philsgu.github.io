## Tap2Sound 

This is a simple iOS app to produce sounds using [C4 framework](http://www.c4ios.com) and Swift. I explored some methods here without using Xcode's interface builder that randomly produces color button feedback with the associated sound.  Here's the [reference to the repository file](https://github.com/philsgu/bell-sound-swift-app-). I'm a mountain biker and thought this might help with bikers wanting to use their mounted phones to give passerby a heads up.
